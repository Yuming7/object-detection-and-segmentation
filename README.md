Object detection and semantic segmentation on the MNIST Double Digits RGB
(MNISTDD-RGB) dataset. This dataset contains RGB images of size 64 Ã— 64 where each has two digits from 0 to 9 placed 
randomly inside it as shown in Figure 1. Your task is to figure out which digits are contained in each image and where are they 
located followed by their precise pixel-wise segmentation masks as in Figure 2.
